    renewable_target[p] is a parameter that describes how much of load (as a percentage) must be served by GENERATION_PROJECTS.
    This assumes that all GENERATION_PROJECTS are renewable generators that count toward the goal.

    hedge_premium_cost[z]

    SystemPower[z, t] is a decision variable for how many average MW of grid power to use to meet demand in each timepoint in each zone.
    This decision variable is considered a power injection in the load balance equation.

    SystemPowerCost[t] is an expression that summarizes the total cost of consuming system power at a given timepoint

    AnnualSystemPower[z,p] is an expression that describes the total system power used in each zone in each period (year)

    Enforce_Hourly_Renewable_Target[z,p] is a contraint that requires time coincident renewable generation from GENERATION_PROJECTS to
    meet or exceed the renewable_target. It is defined by requiring the percentage of system power used to be less than 1 - the target.


    total_demand_in_period[p] is an expression that sums the annual energy demand across all load zones for each period

    total_generation_in_period[p] is an expression that sums the annual renewable generation from all generators for each period

    Enforce_Annual_Renewable_Target[p] is a constraint that requires the total annual  renewable generation to be greater or equal to the percentage
    of total annual load equal to the target.
